    <p>Delicious Indian recipe that is simple, tasty, and full of flavor. 
    This was the first Indian meal I made, and it has stuck around since 
    all of my friends and family love it! Add more or less chiles depending 
    on your spice preference.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Puree water, garlic, serrano chile peppers, and ginger together in a blender or food 
        processor until smooth.</li><br>
        <li>Heat ghee in a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and 
        pepper. Cook chicken in hot ghee until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer 
        chicken to a plate.</li><br>
        <li>Cook and stir garlic puree in the 6-quart saucepan until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 
        onion; cook and stir until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add fenugreek, coriander, garam masala, 
        and turmeric to onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li><br>
        <li>Stir tomatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until tomatoes are lightly browned, 4 
        to 6 minutes. Add chicken, milk, and cream; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover 
        saucepan, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
        Transfer chicken to a serving platter using a slotted spoon. Continue cooking sauce until slightly 
        reduced, 5 to 7 more minutes. Stir cilantro into sauce and pour over chicken.</li><br>
